# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a new bootcamp student, I wanted to create a study guide website that would help others learn simple concepts about  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, while also learning more about the languages myself in the process. The concepts that I learned along the way are outlined in this application.

Each section contains notes about certain topics, pertaining to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If the user accesses the DevTools console, they can observe the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned about in prework, and randomly choose one topic for us to study first.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
